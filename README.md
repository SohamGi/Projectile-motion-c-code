This is with reference to calculatin attributes of sixers in cricket
input required : Maximum height and total horizontal range
output : velocity of ball at instant after hitting and angle of shot
note : This doesnt take air resistance as a factor and angle is an approximate in the lower limit of the actual angle due to
unaccounted height of the player.
these cause an overall approximate value for the output
