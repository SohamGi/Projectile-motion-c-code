This is with reference to calculating attributes of sixers in cricket.
Input required : Maximum height and total horizontal range. 
Output : velocity of ball at instant after hitting and angle of shot. 
Note : This doesnt take air resistance as a factor and angle is an approximate in the lower limit of the actual angle due to
unaccounted height of the player. 
These cause an overall approximate value for the output.
